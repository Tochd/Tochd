- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tochd
- 👀 I’m interested in SSIS, SQL, data warehousing, and then using that data in OLAP for data visualization. 
- My primary platforms are Micorsoft SQL Server, SSIS, and SSAS.
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning to build a SSIS custom component. 
- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on light weight data visualization from SQL views that can be used before begining a deliberate effort to create an OLAP solution.
- - 📫 How to reach me is tochd@gmail.com
